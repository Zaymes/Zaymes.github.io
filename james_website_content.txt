## About Me
I started my journey as an Electronics and Communication Engineer, but my curiosity led me toward the world of open data and civic technology. Over the years, I’ve been part of initiatives that empower communities with better access to information — from open-data platforms to digital public tools.

Currently, I work as the COO at Open Knowledge Nepal (OKN), leading operations, partnerships, and technology projects that promote open data ecosystems in Nepal. Alongside this, I contribute as a General Member of Open Internet Nepal (OIN), where we advocate for digital rights and a more open internet.

My work lies at the intersection of technology, transparency, and public good — helping bridge citizens, data, and policy through meaningful design and collaboration.
